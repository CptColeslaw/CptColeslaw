My name it Blake and I'm a long-time computer enthusiast finally learning to code.

Previously taken college courses for html/css & java.
I'm currently learning c and python and open to learning anything.
I love any kind of coding and problem solving, but am struggling with the financial investments of education.
Willing to pour myself into any project or internship that will pay me to learn,
or redirect my learning towards anything with a job offer at the end.
